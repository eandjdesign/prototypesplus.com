<P><FONT SIZE=+2>P</FONT>rototypes Plus has been located in Menlo Park,
California since the late '70's. Our 7000 square foot shop is extensively
equipped with CNC and manual milling machines, all sizes of pressure pots
for casting, a wide range of woodworking tools for creating molds, multiple
CAD/CAM stations and state of the art stereolithography equipment. We are
large enough to fulfill an impressively wide range of needs, yet small
enough to serve each client's individual needs.&nbsp;

<P><FONT SIZE=+2>G</FONT>eorge Dukes, our vice president and general manager,
has been with the company since 1983. He has been instrumental in the development
of our pioneering R.T.V tooling and casting techniques. As the initial
contact person with every client, his background in each of our departments
means our clients are sure to get the best advice and recommendations to
achieve their ideal end goals.&nbsp;
